Blinkit Retail Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard

This project analyzes the Blinkit retail dataset to uncover key insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency. The analysis aims to support data-driven decision-making by identifying trends, patterns, and high-impact business metrics.

An Excel pivot dashboard was created to track essential KPIs such as monthly sales growth, peak order times, repeat customer rate, and top-performing products and brands. In addition, an interactive Power BI dashboard was designed with advanced features including drill-through analysis, payment method insights, and brand-level performance evaluation.

The insights help businesses optimize inventory planning, marketing strategies, and customer retention efforts.
